# Shell ancestry

A history (ahem) of command shells in Unix and Unix-like systems.

Each shell appears at the year that it was first announced to the
world. For example, S. R. Bourne describes his shell in the *Bell
System Technical Journal* in 1978 but Bell released it to the world in
1979 or so.

A shell uses a solid, black arrow to point to a shell that it
borrows source code from. A shell uses a dashed, grey arrow to point
to a shell that the former attempts to be compatible with while not
using the latter's source code.

A plum-coloured shell has an open, free, or public license.

A green shell had a proprietary or closed license at the time that it was
announced. Source for many formerly-closed shells are now available for us
to look at. For example, Bell Labs released to source code to UNIX,
available in a few links below.

The authors of a shell are the people credited at the time of the shell's
announcement.
